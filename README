NOTE: this project is dead.  I think it's much nicer to list plugins in
your .vimrc and fetch them using vim-update-bundles.

Most of Vimsy's functionality is here, copy the bits that you like:

Here is Vimsy, frozen since November 2010...



                                 Vimsy

                A nice vim-based code-stomping environment


Vimsy is a collection of the best Vim plugins.  It turns Vim into a fast,
flexible, and seriously capable code editor.


INSTALL

Macintosh users:   install MacVim, http://code.google.com/p/macvim
Windows users:     install gvim,   http://www.vim.org/download.php#pc
Debian/Ubuntu:     apt-get install vim-gnome
Fedora users:      yum install vim gvim ctags

Vimsy is tested on Vim 7.2 on Mac/Linux.  It should work reasonably
well on any Vim 7 or higher.


Now, in your home directory:

    git clone git://github.com/bronson/vimsy.git .vim
    git clone git://github.com/bronson/vim-update-bundles.git

create a symbolic link to .vim/vimrc and then run the
vim-update-bundles script:

    ln -s .vim/vimrc .vimrc
    vim-update-bundles/vim-update-bundles

And you're done!


Note that if you want to use command-t, you'll need to build its
C extension manually.

    $ cd ~/.vim/bundle/command-t
    $ rake make


Run ':help vimsy' and ':help bundles' to learn about the good
stuff you have at your disposal.
