TODO:
endwise? http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2386
haml? http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1433
show matching begin/else/end/etc when moving the cursor
tComment looks much tighter than NERD_commenter.  Faster too?
display git branch and file status?
snippets?  would I use them?
folding?   never been happy with folding in the past.  http://eigenclass.org/hiki.rb?simplefold+plugin+0.4.0

sethbc-fuzzy_file_finder can use ff 2.22.3.  is it worth updating?
is it even worth using ff_textmate?  is it that much better than plain ff?


Keystrokes:
B   -- when inside block, converts block between {} and do/end
C-J -- bufexplorer
C-K -- fuzzy file finder
C-/ -- Toggle the comments on the selected lines or current line
,D  -- fire up the nerd tree
,t  -- run the test containing the cursor (like :.Rake but much faster)
,T  -- run all tests in the current file (like :Rake but much faster)
TlistToggle -- show/hide the tag list (updates every updatetime ms)
% jumps between matching begin/if/while/do/rescue/end/etc.  (matchit)


Vim Builtins: (worth mentioning)
C-^ -- edit previous file (file marked with # in the output of :ls), C-W C-^ -- split and switch
:bd -- close current buffer
C-W _ -- maximize current window (:on makes it even more maximal)
C-W T -- open this window in a new tab

:help rails
:help matchit
:help surround


Rails:
gf -- if you're over a class or symbol, try gf.  It should take you.
:A -- go to alternate file (usually test file)
  AS -- split, AV -- vertical split, AT -- tab, AD -- replace current buffer
:R -- got to related file (model/schema, controller/template)
:Rmodel (name) -- go to the named model
  :Rcontroller, :Rview, :Rjavascript, :Rlayout, etc.
:Rake (targets) -- run rake, open errors in quickfix window
  with no targets, tries to figure out from current file
:Rextract -- extract a partial
:Rtree -- open nerdtree view of the Rails project
C-X C-U -- complete current word from Rails keywords


Available Keys
--------------
^H -- just use h
^J -- just use j
^L -- that one time a year you want to redraw the screen, hit :redr


Rejected
--------

allml: Looks like a bunch of obscure keybindings for editing XMLish files.
       Not very exciting or useful.
camelcasemotion: how often do you need to move in a camelcase word?
surround: screws up vi mode (hit v, select some text, then s.  boo!)
