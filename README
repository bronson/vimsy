                                 Vimsy

                A nice vim-based code-stomping environment


Vimsy is a collection of the best Vim plugins.  It turns Vim into a fast,
flexible, and seriously capable code editor.



INSTALL

Macintosh users:   install MacVim, http://code.google.com/p/macvim
Windows users:     install gvim,   http://www.vim.org/download.php#pc
Debian/Ubuntu:     apt-get install vim-gnome
Fedora users:      yum install vim gvim ctags

Then, in your home directory:

    git clone git://github.com/bronson/vimsy.git .vim
    git clone git://github.com/bronson/vim-update-bundles.git

create a symbolic link to .vim/vimrc:

    ln -s .vim/vimrc .vimrc
    vim-update-bundles/vim-update-bundles   # run script with no args

And you're done!

Now run ':help vimsy' to start to learn about all the good stuff
you have at your disposal.

Vimsy is tested on Vim 7.2 on Mac/Linux.  It should work reasonably
well on any Vim 7 or higher.
