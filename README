                                 Vimsy

                A nice vim-based development environment


Vimsy is a collection of the best plugins for Vim.  It turns Vim
into a fast, flexible, and outrageously capable code editor.

See doc/vimsy.txt for more.  Or just run ':help vimsy'.


INSTALL

In your root directory:

    git clone git@github.com:bronson/vimsy.git .vim
    ln -s .vim/vimrc .vimrc

Vimsy is tested on Vim 7.2, although most features should work on
older versions ov Vim.
