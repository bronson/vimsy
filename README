                                 Vimsy

                A nice vim-based code stomping environment


Vimsy is a collection of the greatest plugins for Vim.  It turns Vim
into a fast, flexible, and outrageously capable code editor.

See doc/vimsy.txt for more.  Or just run ':help vimsy'.


INSTALL

In your root directory:

    git clone git@github.com:bronson/vimsy.git .vim
    ln -s .vim/vimrc .vimrc

If you already have your own .vimrc, you can include all of vimsy's
functionality by adding a line like this:

    source ~/.vim/vimrc

This is also how to extend and customize Vimsy.

Vimsy is tested on Vim 7.2 on Mac/Linux.  Most features will still
work on older versions of Vim and on Windows.
