With bufexplorer, you can quickly and easily switch between buffers
by using the one of the default public interfaces (\ is the |mapleader|):

  '\be' (normal open)  or
  '\bs' (force horizontal split open)  or
  '\bv' (force vertical split open)

Now navigate using hjkl and / as usual, enter or mouse click to select.
To open the selected buffer in a new tab, press either <Shift-Enter> or 't'.
To delete the buffer, hit 'd'.

You can sort the buffer list by Most Recently Used (the default),
buffer number, file name, file extensions, and full path.
