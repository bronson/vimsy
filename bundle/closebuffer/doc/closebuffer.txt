*closebuffer.txt*             Close Buffer


This plugin allows you to close a buffer in Vim without affecting any
windows.  Normally when you close a buffer, its window closes too,
forcing you to re-layout all your windows.


                                                *^W^E*  *CTRL-W_CTRL-E*

If you hit ^W^E, the buffer closes and your windows remain untouched.
