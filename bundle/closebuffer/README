This allows you to close a buffer in Vim without affecting the window
it's in.  Normally when you close a buffer, its window closes too,
forcing you to to redo the windows you have open.

I suggest mapping it to Control-W Control-E (eradicate window):

    nmap <C-W><C-E> <Plug>Kwbd
    nmap <C-W>e     <Plug>Kwbd
