2. Keystrokes                                          *vimsy-keystrokes*

Note that we assume Vim's default mapleader of \.  |vimsy-mapleader|

\B  -- when you select a block in visual mode, \B will convert between {} and do/end. *vimsy-blockconv*
C-J -- bufexplorer (original C-J binding did the same thing as j)
\C  -- Toggle the comments on the selected lines or current line
C-/ -- Also toggles comments, see |vimsy-control-/|.
\d  -- toggle the nerd tree
\D  -- show the current file in the nerd tree
\l  -- toggle the tag list
\t  -- run the test containing the cursor (like :.Rake but much faster)
\T  -- run all tests in the current file (like :Rake but much faster)
\w  -- toggle line wrapping on and off
\*  -- grep the entire project for the identifier under the cursor
% jumps between matching begin/if/while/do/rescue/end/etc.  (matchit)
C-Space -- complete word (same as C-X C-O)
C-W e -- closes a buffer but leaves the window open (C-W C-E works too).

Tasks:
Create a file or directory: \d (open nerdtree), put the cursor on the directory to contain the new file, and hit m.
Move or copy files: \d (open nerdtree), put the cursor on the directory to contain the new file, and hit m.

Vim Builtins: Here are some highlights.  Everything is listed in |index.txt|.
C-^ -- edit previous file (file marked with # in the output of :ls), C-W C-^ -- split and switch
:wa -- write all buffers (Save All)
:wqa -- write all buffers and quit
C-W _ -- maximize current window. C-W o or :on (:only) makes it even more maximal.
C-W T -- open this window in a new tab
C-W KJHL -- move current window to the extreme border (J makes it full width at the bottom of the screen, etc)
C-W rR -- rotate open windows clockwise / counterclockwise
H M L -- move cursor on screen to high, middle, low
C-T / C-D -- (insert mode) insert tab / delete tab from beginning of line
C-O / C-I -- go to older / newer cursor position (see |jump-motions|)
Tabs: :tabnew, :tabnext (gt), :tabprev (gT), :close
[m ]m -- move to the previous or next method/function
[[ ][ -- move to previous or next outermost { } brace (ruby: class or module)
[( ]( -- move to previous or next paren ( )
gd gD -- go to definition of variable under cursor (d searches function, D searches file)
gq -- reformat comment (visually select first, or hit
      gq]/ to reformat to the end of the current comment block)

Rails:
gf -- if you're over a class or symbol, try gf.  It should take you.
:A -- go to alternate file (usually to the test file)
  AS -- split, AV -- vertical split, AT -- tab, AD -- replace current buffer
:R -- got to related file (model/schema, controller/template)
  RS -- split, RV -- vertical split, RT -- tab, RD -- replace current buffer
:Rmodel (name) -- go to the named model
  :Rcontroller, :Rview, :Rjavascript, :Rlayout, etc.
:Rake (targets) -- run rake, open errors in quickfix window
  with no targets, tries to figure out from current file
:Rextract -- extract a partial (in your view, use v to select the code to extract, hit :Rextract NAME (name of your partial), and out it comes
:Rtree -- open nerdtree view of the Rails project (any diff from \d?)
C-X C-U -- complete current word from Rails keywords


Available Keystrokes -- common keystrokes that are available for vimsy's use.
^H -- just use h
^N -- just use j (ex-emacs users might want this left alone)
^P -- just use k (ex-emacs users might want this left alone)

3. DISCUSSION                                            *vimsy-discussion*

Vimsy includes some controversial features.  If you see surprising
behavior, this section may address it.  (If you're surprised that you
*don't* see an expected behavior, check |vimsy-rejected-plugins|).


Map Leader                                               *vimsy-mapleader*

A lot of tutorials recommend changing vim's |mapleader| from "\" to ",".
We don't do this because hanging the mapleader would violate vimsy's goal
of least surprise.  Luckily it's trivial to do this on your own: just
drop this into your ~/.vimrc before including vimsy's stuff:

    let mapleader = ","
    source $HOME/.vim/vimrc


Control-/                                                *vimsy-control-/*

This is the one keybinding that all IDEs use to toggle comments.  Vimsy
supports this, but there's a caveat: most terminals convert Control-/ to
Control-_, so we must bind to Control-_.  Since Control-_ is already used
to switch RTL/LTR, Hebrew and Farsi developers may find vimsy's behavior
surprising.

Furthermore, vim-gtk, vim-gnome, and MacVim are unable to produce Control-/.
You can test this for yourself:
  - hit i to enter insert mode, then hit control-V control-/.
  - if you see "^/" or "^_", your version of Vim can recognize Control-/.
  - if you see "/", then you can't use Control-/.  You must toggle
    commenting with Control-_ or <leader>C.

3. TODO                                                   *vimsy-todo*

Do we still need RubySpec now that RubyTest does specs?
Hitting Control-] on "empty?" complains E426: tag not found: empty\?  (must set autocmd FileType ruby setlocal iskeyword+=!,? for this to work)
Add ack plugin or something to make searching easier.
Add a color switcher and some decent color themes.

Maybe set tw=72 for text files only?  That seems unintrusive and useful?
Organize this todo list by package and concept!
Add tag closing: http://pastey.net/132688-2fb8 or http://github.com/mitechie/pyvim/blob/master/vim/ftplugin/xml.vim
How to I make HTML tags auto-close?  Or can I make completion close tags?
Can I join forces with http://github.com/mitechie/pyvim ?
Integrate http://github.com/astashov/vim-ruby-debugger (how does one debug regular ruby apps, or generators?)
Move the swapfiles somewhere else, it's a pain to .gitignore them.
Remove nerdtree in favor of built-in netrw, but not without removing features!
  Can we remove the horrible banner?  Maybe not: http://www.mail-archive.com/vim_use@googlegroups.com/msg06925.html
Figure out a keypress to toggle :set paste! on and off.  I do it a lot.
How do I cancel bufexplorer and to back to the file I was editing without changing the previous file (Control-6)?  Hitting esc doesn't work.
Rails vim -- turn off logfile tweaks.  Coloring makes opening large files painful, plus it breaks 1G, 500G, etc to navigate in the file.
Also make bufexplorer support s and v to open new buffer horiz or vertically split.
What is omnifunc and how is it different from C-X C-U
Add a.vim (alternate) http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=31 and map the keys to be the same as railsmode.
test |vimsy-control-/| with winvim and maybe motif vim.
Add :ver N and :hor N commands to set the vertical and horizontal size of the current window
NT: Should probably let ? be search backward, use h for help.
NT: control-J should open buf explorer
NT: Make space behave the same as return when navigating the tree.
Also make bufexplorer to use h for help.
NT: Make a keystroke to fire off a grep/ack from that directory (or parent dir of curr file)
NT: Add c/n to nerdtree for one-step file creation
NT: Can I hit L on a dir or file to produce a :Glog there?
Add http://github.com/adamlogic/ack.vim/commit/850e83088e0a623390446ea88fc8740857777f25 ?
Add a way to tell what color is under the cursor?  :echo synIDattr(synID(line('.'),col('.'),1),'name')
rubytest should save the file before running the tests.
rubytest should not scan for valid tests if running with T.  Just run the file.
rubytest definitely needs to present its quickfix better.  (crib from recent rails.vim?)
Make \w toggle through wrapping: nowrap, wrap by word, wrap by character.  Right now ,w only cycles nowrap and wrap by word.
haml? http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1433
instead of railstest, http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2869 ?
I'd like Rails plugin to support :Routes/:Rroutes, :Rschema, and :Renvironment?
show matching begin/else/end/etc when moving the cursor
adding html textobjects seems rather useful: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3000
Display git branch and file status?  http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2258
folding?   never been happy with folding in the past.  http://eigenclass.org/hiki.rb?simplefold+plugin+0.4.0
vividchalk: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1891
get newest haml indent/syntax (2008 Sep 11) included in vim distro.  (just one regex change)
is it possible to extract rails.vim's rSpec functionality and use it instead of current rSpec stuff?
Is it possible to unit test this mess?  http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2565
ruby indentation screws up when I type end_date, it unindents prematurely.  It should wait for the next character before doing that.

Bug in ERb indentation:
  <% semantic_form_for(:rep, report,
               :html => { :method => :get },
               :url => { :action => :output }
              ) do |form| %>
    <%= form.input :type, :as => :hidden, :value => 'groovy' %>
  If you auto-indent this, everything ends up too far to the right.
  But, if you put semantic_form_for all on one line, it gets it right.

4. Rejected Plugins            *vimsy-rejplugins*  *vimsy-rejected-plugins*

These are plugins that were considered but not used.  See
|vimsy-plugins| for the list of currently installed plugins.

camelcasemotion    How often do you need to move within a camelcase word?
             Is it really worth learning custom move keys over f and b?

fugitive     Even now, months later, the read and write commands still feel
             weird.  I give up and will now try to find something more gitish.

original fuzzyfinder    So laborious to use that I don't see why anyone
             would use it over vim's :find built-in.  It's horrible.

fuzzyfinder-textmate    Jamis wrote this, then abandoned it when the
             fuzzyfinder script kept breaking his changes.  Others have
             tried to pick up the slack but it hasn't been satisfying.
             Vimsy used ff-tm until 5 Aug 2010.

specky       Includes a bunch of non-rspec-related garbage.  It's hard
             enough to get vim scripts to reliably coexist as it is,
             there's no need to bring along unrelated stuff!

vim-rspec    relies on Ruby+hpricot/xsltproc parsing HTML?  Seems rather
             overcomplex.  Glad I found a simpler alternative.


==============================================================================
5. Changes                                             *vimsy-changes*

04 Aug 2010 - drop fugitive, it just feels too different.
04 Aug 2010 - Switch wholesale to Pathogen.

==============================================================================
6. About                                               *vimsy-about*

Vimsy was assembled by Scott Bronson, brons_vimsy@rinspin.com.
Its vimrc was written from scratch but cribbed heavily from
http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Example_vimrc and Akita's version of
Scrooloose's vimfiles.
